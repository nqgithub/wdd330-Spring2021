    <p>From the book: HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd Eddition</p>


    <h3> Chapters 8 and 12 </h3>

        <h4> CSS3 Transforms and Transitions </h4>

        <h4> Transforms </h4>
        <li> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate,
            scale, and/or skew any element on the page. While some of these
            effects were possible using previously existing CSS features
            (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning),
            CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of
            the element’s appearance. </li>
        <li> Transforms let you rotate, scale and or scew elements.</li>

        <br>

        <h4> Translation </h4>
        <li> Translation
            Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right,
            up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of
            position: relative; when declaring top and left , moving
            elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.
            When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements
            without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position:
            relative , which allows you to position an element either against
            its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a
            translated element can only be moved relative to its current
            position.
            <br>
            The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left,
            and y from the top: </li>
       <br>

       <br>
       

        <h4> Note: Transforms and Older Browsers </h4>
        <li> Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3,
            iOS8, and Blackberry 10. </li>
        <li> Inclued this code if you want to run transformers on older browsers. </li>

        <br>

        <h4> More on Translation </h4>
        <li> If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally,
            you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul> Example: </ul>
        <ul> To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include: </ul>

        <br> 
        <img src="week8Pictures/moreOnTranslation-1_result.jpg" alt="moreOnTranslation-1 Picture">
        <br>


        <br>
        <ul> To move up along the y axis by 30px, include: </ul>
        
        <br> 
        <img src="week8Pictures/moreOnTranslation-2_result.jpg" alt="moreOnTranslation-2 Picture">
        <br>
        
        
        <br>
        <li> Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix.
            Just add "display: inline-block;" to your span: </li>

        <ul> Example: </ul>
        <br>

        <br>

        <li> By doing this when the user hovers over "Dukes" the word will more to
            the right by 40px as intended.</li>

        <h4> Scaling </h4>
        <li> Scaling
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors
            horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided,
            it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking
            your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect
            ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size,
            scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them,
            and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as
            you’d expect:</li>
        <ul> For examople: </ul>
        <ul> You could use "transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);" </ul>
        <ul> or </ul>
        <ul> "scale(2)" to double it. or "scale(0.5)" to half it. </ul>
        <ul> You can also us "scaleX(x)" for just the x axis or "scaleY(y)" for the
            y axis. </ul>
        <br>
        
        <!-- --------------- Example of scaling that didn't work ----------------- -->
        <!-- <h3>Normal</h3>
        <h3 style="transform: scale(1.5,0.25);"> This is bigger</h3> -->


        <br>

        <br>

        <h4> Rotation </h4>
        <li> The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin
            by a specified angle value. As with scale , by default the point of
            origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in
            degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving
            counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in
            grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees. </li>
        <li> Make sure that you add this all on one line (Look at the transform part
            in the picture below.) </li>
        <li>Also make sure you more the rotation transormation by degrees.
            (Example rotate(10deg)</li>
        <br>
        <h1 style="color:red; transform: rotate(-12deg);"> Example of rotation </h1>

        <br>

        <h4> Skew </h4>
        <li> The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.
            As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the
            y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted,
            the skew will only occur on the x axis: </li>
        <br>
        <h1 style="color: blue; transform: skew(15deg, 4deg); "> Example of Skew</h1>

        <ul>Example code: </ul>

        <br>

        <h4> Canvas </h4>
        <li> Canvas is an API that allows you to draw anything using 
            JavaScript. </li>
        <li>  In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images 
            and even video. </li>
        <li> The Canvas API is supported in: Chrome 4+, Firefox 2+, Opera 9.6+,
            Safari 3.1+, iOS 3.2+, Internet Explorer 9.0+, Android 3.0+ </li>
        <li>Canvas ws designed by Apple. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Canvas Setup </li>

        <br> 

        <img src="week8Pictures/canvas-4_result.jpg" alt="canvas-4 Picture">
        <br>
        
        <li>Note: All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.</li>
        <br>

        <h4> Getting the Context </h4>
        <li> This section has to do with getting the context of the canvas board.</li>
        <li> Canvas's context is just the rendering portion of the drawing. </li>

        <br> 
        <img src="week8Pictures/gettingTheContext-1_result.jpg" alt="gettingTheContext-1 Picture">
        <br>

        <li> This, above, is 2d but 3d is supported with the latest browsers. </li>
        
        <br>

        <h4> Filling Our Brush with Color </h4>
        <li> On a real-life painting canvas, you must first saturate your brush with 
            paint before you can begin. In the HTML5 canvas, you must do the same, 
            and we do so with the strokeStyle or fillStyle properties. Both strokeStyle 
            and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three 
            values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a 
            CanvasPattern object. </li>
        <li> Think of the stroke as the border of the shape you’re going to draw. </li>
        <ul> Example: To draw a rectangle with a red border, we first define the stroke color: </ul>
        

        <br>
        <h4> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h4>
        <li>SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe 
            vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, 
            unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their 
            quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down.</li>
