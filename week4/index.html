  <h4>Forms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Forms are made up of a "form" element that contains form controls such
      as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be
      populated with information that is processed once the form has been
      submitted. </li>
    <br>

    <ul>Code</ul>

    <p>------------- searchingExample-1 --------------</p>

    <br>

    <ul>A searching example</ul>
    <form name='search' action='/search'>
      <input name='searchInput'>
      <button type='submit'>Search</button>
    </form>
    <script src='/week4/main.js'></script>

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> A form object has a method called elements that returns
      an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. </li>
    <li> The square bracket notation is useful if there are any naming clashes
      with existing property and method names, or if the name is an invalid
      variable name. </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Form Properties and Methods</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Form objects have a many useful properties and methods that can be
      used to interact with the form. </li>
    <li> The "form.submit()" method will submit the form automatically.
      Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form
      submit event. </li>
    <li>Submit the form automatically= use "form.submit()"</li>
    <li>Reset all the form controls back to their initial values
      specified in the HTML. = "button type='reset'>Reset/'button' </li>

    <ul>Example:</ul>
    <ul><button type='reset'>Reset</button></ul>

    <br>

    <li> Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability,
      as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s
      been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form. </li>
    <li> The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of
      a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server: </li>
    <li> To set the forms action = " form.action = '/an/other.url' "</li>

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Form Events</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Forms trigger events. </li>
    <li> Focus Element = The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. 
      In the case of an <'input'> element, this is when the cursor is placed 
      inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to 
      it using the keyboard) </li>
    <br>
    <ul>Example:</ul>

    <p> ------------ focusEvent-1 ---------------</p>

    <br>

    <li>Blur event = The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away 
      from the form element. </li>

    <p> -------------- blurEvent-1 --------------</p>

    <br>

    <li>Change event = The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the 
      form elementafter changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and 
      makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire, 
      but the blur event will. </li>

      <p> -------------- changeEvent-1 --------------</p>

  </ul>
