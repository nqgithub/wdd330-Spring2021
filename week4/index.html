  <h3>Chapter 8, 12, 15</h3>

  <h4>Forms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Forms are made up of a "form" element that contains form controls such
      as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be
      populated with information that is processed once the form has been
      submitted. </li>
    <br>

    <ul>Code</ul>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/searchingExample-1_result.jpg" alt="searchingExample-1 Picture" />


    <br>

    <ul>A searching example</ul>
    <form name='search' action='/search'>
      <input name='searchInput'>
      <button type='submit'>Search</button>
    </form>
    <script src='/week4/main.js'></script>

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> A form object has a method called elements that returns
      an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. </li>
    <li> The square bracket notation is useful if there are any naming clashes
      with existing property and method names, or if the name is an invalid
      variable name. </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Form Properties and Methods</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Form objects have a many useful properties and methods that can be
      used to interact with the form. </li>
    <li> The "form.submit()" method will submit the form automatically.
      Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form
      submit event. </li>
    <li>Submit the form automatically= use "form.submit()"</li>
    <li>Reset all the form controls back to their initial values
      specified in the HTML. = "button type='reset'>Reset/'button' </li>

    <ul>Example:</ul>
    <ul><button type='reset'>Reset</button></ul>

    <br>

    <li> Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability,
      as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s
      been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form. </li>
    <li> The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of
      a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server: </li>
    <li> To set the forms action = " form.action = '/an/other.url' "</li>

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Form Events</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Forms trigger events. </li>
    <li> Focus Element = The focus event occurs when an element is focused on.
      In the case of an <'input'> element, this is when the cursor is placed
        inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to
        it using the keyboard) </li>
    <br>
    <ul>Example:</ul>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/focusEvent-1_result.jpg" alt="focusEvent-1 Picture" />


    <br>

    <li>Blur event = The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away
      from the form element. </li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/blurEvent-1_result.jpg" alt="blurEvent-1 Picture" />


    <br>

    <li>Change event = The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the
      form elementafter changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and
      makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire,
      but the blur event will. </li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/changeEvent-1_result.jpg" alt="changeEvent-1 Picture" />

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>Submitting a Form</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> To submit the content of the form use the "submit" event. </li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/submitForm-1_result.jpg" alt="submitForm-1 Picture" />



    <li> Once you implement the code above you should see a dialog saying "Form submitted" </li>
    <li> You can also stop the form from being submitted by using the "preventDefault()" method </li>
    <li>Example:</li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/submitForm-2_result.jpg" alt="submitForm-2 Picture" />


  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4> Place Holder Attribute </h4>
  <ul>
    <li> The placeholder attribute is a grayed out text area within a box. </li>
    <li> A placeholder attribute can be done wit the following code:</li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/placeHolder-1_result.jpg" alt="placeHolder-1 Picture" />


  </ul>

  <h4> Form Controls </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <'input'> = Input fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads
    </li>
    <li>
      <'select'> = Menus for drop-down lists of options
    </li>
    <li>
      <'textarea'> = Elements for longer text entry
    </li>
    <li>
      <'button'> = Elements for submitting and resetting forms
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Input Fields </h4>
  <ul>
    <li> "text" = Used for entering a short piece of text </li>
    <li> Value attribute = The initial value of this field can be set in the HTML using the value attribute. </li>
    <li> </li>

  </ul>

  <h4> Password Input Fields </h4>
  <ul>
    <li> "input type='password'" = is used to enter passwords or secret information. </li>

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/passwordInput-1_result.jpg" alt="passwordInput-1 Picture" />

    <img src="/week4/week4Pictures/passwordInput-2_result.jpg" alt="passwordInput-2 Picture" />

  </ul>


  <h4>Checkbox Input Fields</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> To create a check box set the type as "checkbox" </li>
    <li>Syntax: type='checkbox'</li>
    <li>Example:</li>
    <p>Super Powers: Check the appropriate box </p>
    <label for='flight'>Flight:
      <input type='checkbox' id='flight' value='Flight' name='powers'>
    </label>
    <label for='strength'>Super Strength:
      <input type='checkbox' id='strength' value='Strength' name='powers'>
    </label>
    <label for='speed'>Super Speed:
      <input type='checkbox' id='speed' value='Super Speed' name='powers'>
    </label>
    <label for='energy'>Energy Blasts:
      <input type='checkbox' id='energy' value='Energy Blasts' name='powers'>
    </label>
    <label for='telekinesis'>Telekinesis:
      <input type='checkbox' id='telekinesis' value='Telekinesis' name='powers'>
    </label>

    <br>
    <br>


    <li> Notice that all the checkbox elements have the same 'name' property of 'powers'.
      This means they can be accessed as an HTML collection, like so: "form.powers;" </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Radio Button Input Fields</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> To active this or included this change the type to "radio". </li>
    <li>Syntax= type='radio' </li>
    <li>Example:</li>
    <p>What type of hero are you?</p>
    <label for='hero'>Hero:
      <input type='radio' name='category' value='Hero' id='hero'>
    </label>
    <label for='villain'>Villain:
      <input type='radio' name='category' value='Villain' id='villain'>
    </label>
    <label for='anti-hero'>Anti-Hero:
      <input type='radio' name='category' value='Antihero' id='anti-hero'>
    </label>

    <br>
    <br>

    <li> All these radio buttons have the same 'name' attribute of 'category'. You can group'
      then together under a name called category </li>
    <li>Access this group with the syntax: form.category; </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Other Input Types</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> There are lots of new input types included in HTML5, such as number , tel and color </li>
    <li> To add age to a value include this syntax = </li>
    <br>
    <label for='age'>Super Hero's Age:
      <input type='number' id='age' name='age' min=0 step=1></label>
    <br>

  </ul>

  <h4>Select Drop-Down List</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Select drop-down lists can be used to select one or more options from a list of values.
      The 'multiple' attribute is required if more than one option is to be selected. We’ll use
      one in our example to choose the city where our hero operates. </li>
    <br>
    <label for='City'>Super Hero's base of Operations:
      <select name='city' id='city'>
        <option value='' selected>Choose a City</option>
        <option value='Metropolis'>Metropolis</option>
        <option value='Gotham City'>Gotham City</option>
        <option value='Keystone City'>Keystone City</option>
        <option value='Coast City'>Coast City</option>
        <option value='Star City'>Star City</option>
      </select>
    </label>

    <br>
    <br>

  </ul>

  <h4>Text Area</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> A <textarea> element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple 
      lines such as a comment or blog post. They work in much the same way as input 
      fields. We access them using the 'name' attribute, and use the value property 
      to see what text was entered. </li>
<br>
      <label for='origin'>Origin Story:
        <textarea id='origin' name='origin' rows='20' cols='60'></textarea>
      </label>
      </br>

  </ul>

  <h4>Buttons</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset button</li>
    <button type='reset'>Reset</button>
    <br>
    <br>

    <li> How to crete a reset buttin: <'button type='reset'>Reset</'button>'" </li>

  </ul>

  <h4> Object Oriented Programming </h4>
  <h5>Programming</h5>
  <li> Programmingis about making computers do what you want. A computer program
    is basically a series of instructions that tell your computer how to perform a task. </li>
  <li>A computer only knows 1's and 0's</li>

  <h5>Low Level Programming Languages</h5>
  <li> Includes: Machine code and assemby language </li>

  <h5>High-level Programming Languages </h5>
  <li>High-level Programming Languages allow abstractions to be used that make the code easier
    for humans to read and write. Programs are written in a language such as C, C++ or Java,
    which is then compiled into machine code and executed. The programs written using these
    languages are very fast, making high-level languages suited to writing games and professional
    business software where speed is important. Most native apps are also written in
    higher-level languages. </li>
  <li> These kinds of languages are faster and are easier for humans to read and write code in.
    Most programs now are written in high-level programming</li>

  <h5>Scripting languages</h5>
  <li>Scripting languagesare also high-level, but they are interpreted, which means they are
    translated into machine code at run time. This often makes them slower than compiled languages,
    although interpreters are becoming ever more sophisticated, and increasingly blurring the
    lines between compiled and interpreted languages.</li>
  <li>Simmilar to High-level languages a scripting language only translates into machine code
    durring runtime</li>

  </ul>

  <br>

  <h4>JavaScript</h4>
  <li> Nearly all web browsers can run JavaScript, making it one of the most popular programming
    languages in the world. </li>
  <li> JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that is interpreted and compiled at run time. </li>
  <li> JavaScript is a dynamic language, so elements of a program can change while it's running,
    and it can do lots of things in the background at run time, such as type checking. </li>

  <h5>History of JavaScript</h5>
  <li>Created by Brendan Eich, Netscape (an early browser vendor) worker. </li>
  <li>The new language was originally called Mocha, but it was changed to LiveScript, then hastily
    rebranded as JavaScript</li>
