  <h3> Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging </h3>
  <br>

  <div>
    <h4> Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings </h4>
    <li> Errors can be one od the following</li>
    <ul>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
      with which the program is interacting. </ul>

    <ul> Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic;
      it could even be as simple as a typo. </ul>

    <ul> User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program
      is unable to handle.</ul>

    <li> External errors like monitors, cables, etc. we cann't do much but
      programming errors are something that as a programmer we are in charge
      of. User errors are also another possibility. As programmers we should help
      make programs more user friendly so users don't make errors. </li>

    <br>

    <h4>Exceptions and Stack Traces</h4>
    <li> Exception: an error that produces a return value that can then be
      used by the program to deal with the error. </li>
    <li> Stack Traces: An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a
      sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where
      the error occurred. </li>

    <br>

    <h4> Warnings </h4>
    <li> A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough
      to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to
      run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic,
      since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to
      continue running incorrectly. </li>

    <ul> Example: Assigning a value to a variable that’s undeclared. </ul>
    <li> Runtime error: When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML
      will still appear, but the JavaScript code will stop working in the background. </li>
    <li> Warning error: If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run
      (although possibly incorrectly).</li>

    <h4> The Importance of Testing and Debugging </h4>
    <li> JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors. </li>
    <li> When an error occurs Java will still run and the error will occur silently
      in the background. </li>

    <h4> Strict Mode </h4>
    <li> Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the
      use of some deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode
      considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being
      'poor style' as actual errors. </li>
    <li> The purpose of strict mode is to have the browser idintify 'sloppy' programming.
      This will reduce 'sloppy' progrmming and make the program cleaner and run faster. </li>
    <li> To use strict mode to clean up your Javascript type in the string " 'use strict'; "
      one the first line of Javascript program </li>
    <li> This will be picked up by any JavaScript engine that uses strict mode. If the
      engine does not support strict mode, this string will simply be ignored. </li>
    <li> You can also implement Strict mode by adding it into a function and it will only
      run in that function. </li>

    <h4> Linting Tools </h4>
    <li> Linting tools are used to test the quality of JavaScript code </li>
    <li> Linting tools are also designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or
      syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such
      as how code is indented. </li>
    <li> Examples of Linting Tools: JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint </li>


    <h4> Feature Detection </h4>
    <li> Feature detection is a way to determine if a feature is supported on a browser </li>
    <li> How-to: This can be done by writing a if statment to check whether an object or
      method exists before trying to actually call the method. </li>

    <br>
    <img src="/week5/week5Pictures/featureDetection-1_result.jpg" alt="featureDetection-1 Picture" />
    <br>


    <li> This ensures that no error occurs if the browser doesn’t support the method,
      because referencing a nonexistent object such as window.virtualReality will return
      undefined . As it’s a falsy value, the if block won’t run, but calling the method
      virtualReality.activate() outside of the if block would cause an exception to be thrown.
      Feature detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and
      fails gracefully, without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn't exist. </li>

    <h4> Debugging in the Browser </h4>
    <li> Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
      dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always
      where it originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see what’s happening
      at different stages of its execution. </li>
    <li> To help with this you can use breakpoints. Which are breaking up you code into segments
      that you can test to identify where the error/ bug is. </li>

    <ul>
      <h4> Examples: </h4>

      <h5> Alerts </h5>
      <li> The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog
        at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until
        OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us
        check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them
        to be. </li>

      <br>
      <ul>This is and example of it not working because the age is less than 18.</ul>

      <br>



      <h5> Using the Console </h5>
      <li> Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number
        of methods for logging information and debugging. It's not officially part of the
        ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers
        and Node.js. </li>
      <li> This action is used kind of like a breakpoint but it does not actually stop the
        code at all. Instead it logs it out to the console, but only if you put console.log
        throughout the code. </li>
