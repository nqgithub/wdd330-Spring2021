  <h3> Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging </h3>

  <h4> Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings </h4>
  <div>
    <li> Errors can be one od the following</li>
    <ul>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
      with which the program is interacting. </ul>

    <ul> Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic;
      it could even be as simple as a typo. </ul>

    <ul> User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program
      is unable to handle.</ul>

    <li> External errors like monitors, cables, etc. we cann't do much but
      programming errors are something that as a programmer we are in charge
      of. User errors are also another possibility. As programmers we should help
      make programs more user friendly so users don't make errors. </li>

    <br>

    <h4>Exceptions and Stack Traces</h4>
    <li> Exception: an error that produces a return value that can then be
      used by the program to deal with the error. </li>
    <li> Stack Traces: An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a
      sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where
      the error occurred. </li>

    <br>

    <h4> Warnings </h4>
    <li> A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough
      to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to
      run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic,
      since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to
      continue running incorrectly. </li>

    <li> Example: Assigning a value to a variable that’s undeclared </li>
    <li> Runtime error: When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML
      will still appear, but the JavaScript code will stop working in the background. </li>
    <li> Warning error: If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run
      (although possibly incorrectly).</li>

    <h4> The Importance of Testing and Debugging </h4>
    <li> JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors. </li>
    <li> When an error occurs Java will still run and the error will occur silently
      in the background. </li>

    <h4> Warnings </h4>
