        <h4> The Window Object </h4>

        <h4> The Browser Object Model (BOM) </h4>
        <li> The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties
            and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
            For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page
            (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of
            the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the
            current page. </li>
        <li> The code below is how you can assign your object to a global scope: </li>

        <h4> Going Global </h4>
        <li> Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser
            environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any
            global variable created is actually a property of the window object </li>
        <li> To make something a global object you don't use const, let, or var. </li>
        <li> Any global variable created is actually a property of the window object </li>
        <li> Some functions weâ€™ve already met, such as parseInt() and isNaN() , are
            actually methods of the global object, which in a browser environment makes
            them methods of the window object: </li>

        <h4> Dialogs </h4>
        <li> In Chapter 1, we introduced three functions that produced dialogs in the
            browsers: alert() , confirm() and prompt() . These are not part of the
            ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as methods
            of the window object. </li>
        <li> The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and
            display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument
            to the method, and undefined is always returned: </li>
        <li> You can user the coed below to create a popup window the user can then 
            close</li>
        <li> To create a popup window you can use alert(), confirm(), or propmt().
            All of these will work but display diffrent messages. See below.</li>

        <ul>Confirm Window</ul>
        <li> You use "confirm()" or "windows.confirm('Message goes here');" </li>

        <li> You use "prompt()" or "windows.prompt('Message goes here');" </li>

        <h4> Which Browser? </h4>
        <li> The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference 
            to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information 
            about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return 
            information about the browser and operating system being used.  </li>
        <li> For this you can use the "window.navigator.userAgent" command but don't 
            rely on this command because it can be off/wrong. </li>
        
        
        <h4> Window Location </h4>
        <li> You can user the "window.location" command to get informtion about the 
            URL as a string. </li>        
            <br>
            <img src="/week9/week9Pictures/windowLocation-1_result.jpg" alt="windowLocation-1 Picture">
            <br>

           
        <h4>Network commands</h4>
        <li> The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used 
            (such as http , https , pop2 , ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon 
            ( : ) at the end: </li>

        <br>
      

        <li> The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current 
            URLandthe port number (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is 
            used): </li>

        <br>
        
        <li> The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the 
            current URL: </li>

        <img src="/week9/week9Pictures/hostnameLocation-1_result.jpg" alt="hostnameLocation-1 Picture">
        <br>

        <li> The port property returns a string describing the port number, although 
            it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in 
            the URL: </li>
        <br>
        <img src="/week9/week9Pictures/portLocation-1_result.jpg" alt="portLocation-1 Picture">
        <br>


        <li> The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the 
            domain: </li>

        <h4>Screen Information</h4>
        <li> The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser 
            is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the screen in 
            pixels using the height and width properties respectively: </li>

        <br>
       
            
        <li> The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of 
            the screen, excluding any operating system menus: </li>
