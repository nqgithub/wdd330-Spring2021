    <h4> Function Properties and Methods </h4>
    <li> The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have
      properties and methods themselves. For example, all functions have a length
      property that returns the number of parameters the function has. </li>

    <br>

    <h4> Call and Apply Methods </h4>
    <li> The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function
      to an object that is provided as the first argument. </li>
    <li> If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be
      provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of this </li>
    <li> If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called
      using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument. </li>

    <h4> Custom Properties </h4>
    <li> There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions
      in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript.
      For example, you could add a description property to a function that
      describes what it does: </li>

    <br>

    <h4> Memoization </h4>
    <li> This is basicly saving or storing the results/ cache of a function. 
      So if the function gets called again it can just show the result that 
      it has already found, instead of running the entire function again. </li>
      <br>
    <ul> Example: </ul>

    <h4> Ajax </h4>
    <li> Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously 
      with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. 
      This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as 
      portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest 
      of the program continues to run. </li>
      <li>A.K.A. This allows websites to update and continue to work in the 
        background</li>
    
<br>

    <h4> Clients and Servers </h4>
    <li> The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: 
      clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource 
      (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back 
      a response to the client. </li>

    <li> JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting language, 
      meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic features to the 
      web page that was returned from the server. Ajax allows JavaScript to request 
      resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested 
      are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole 
      web page. </li>

    <li> Consequently, a server is required when requesting resources using Ajax. 
      Typically this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, 
      Node.js, or .NET to serve the data response following an Ajax request 
      (usually from a back-end database). </li>
    <li> Java script can work in the background and ask from information from the 
      server on behalf of the browser (client). </li>
